# Mailbox project

## Project description:
The goal is to create a device which would store deliveries. Basic idea is to allow couriers to leave the delivery inside the box. After closure the lock may be opened with special code, generated and sent by SMS or email to end user (recipient).

## Technology stack:
- Python
- sqlite3 
- PyQt5
- Django
- Fusion360
- Raspbian

## Main milestones: 
1. Ordering hardware: electronic lock, WiFi router, buttons, wires, Raspberry Pi. Ordering 3D printing materials. 
2. Preparing 3D models for printing the parts of a box. 
3. UI programming for end users and service menu for technical staff.
4. Back-end programming (SMS/email sending)
5. Setting up Raspbian (creating  and setting up the service files, touchscreen setup etc)
6. Assembling the box: electronic lock, wires and buttons connection to Raspberry pins, assembling plastic elements together, adjusting power supply and internet connection.
